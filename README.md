- Manual testing assets (Postman collection)
- Automated tests (integration tests)

## Repository structure
- `backend/` – REST API (SUT)
- `docs/` – requirements, test plan, test cases, traceability matrix
- `manual-testing/` – Postman collections and evidence
- `automated-tests/` – automated test suites

## Status
